🖖🏾 Hi, I’m Sonia aka Umute6

🎨 Creative mind with a tech-driven mindset
I started my journey in advertising and sales, and later reoriented my career towards IT and project management.

💻 Code & Creativity
I’ve worked with Python, C#, JavaScript, and Unity to develop apps and small games. You’ll also find some of my published projects on itch.io. 
My approach blends technical curiosity with storytelling and design.

🌍 Languages & Collaboration
Trilingual in French, English, and Dutch, with a strong interest in Japanese and Italian. I love working in diverse teams where communication, open-mindedness, and problem-solving create meaningful results.

🚀 What’s next?
I’m now looking for opportunities in IT project coordination / junior project management, where I can combine my technical background, creativity, and people skills to help teams deliver impactful projects.
